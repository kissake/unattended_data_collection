How to use:

Set up Raspberry Pi
<Stuff goes here>

Power on (plug into power)
Attach microphone (currently camera too, camera not used)
Confirm that the light is on.
Wait until you think interesting audio has occurred some time in the past 24 hours, and interesting audio has stopped
Unplug the microphone.
Plug in the USB stick.
Wait until the light goes out.  This will take a little while, as all of the MP3 files for the past 24 hours need to be put into a zip file on the USB drive.  Expected size for this is about 1/4GB (250MB), and it transfers about 1MB/s in early testing.  The light will only stay out for 20 seconds, but once done, it is done.
Plug the microphone back in (won't start recording until the 10s of minutes (5:10, 5:20, 5:30, 5:40, etc.), but for intended use, this is low cost).

To turn off:
Unplug camera.
Wait some small amount of time (small # seconds?)
Unplug from power.
